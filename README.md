### Configure config file

We have a config file in this project calling ```` config.py ````. This file should be copied and the copied file should 
be renamed to ``` config_dev.py ```. Then you can configure the paths to the origin recorded data.
The constant ``` SAVEPATH ``` defines where the processed data will be saved e.g. the recorded data as numpy array.
The respective folders are created when starting the process/program.
